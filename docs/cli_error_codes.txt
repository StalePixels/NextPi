NextPi Error Codes

When a NextPi CLI command fails, the errors are creatged in a specific format, 
as follows:

    ERROR:INT string

The following codes are currently in use, with a longer form version of messages
and should be standard across all NextPi CLI API scripts:

0:  This script requires UID 0, aka root, permissions.  This should actually
    be the default UID for most NextPi operations, so if you are seeing this
    something "strange" is afoot.
    
1:  Invalid parameters for this function.  Generic "wrong invocation" error -
    check the online documentation and try again -- run the CLI tool with no 
    parameters for a link to the docs.
    
2:  Missing dependency.  Many functions depend upon files being in the correct
    places on NextPi, and one of the expected, pre-installed, files is not
    present.  This should only ever occour if you have a corrupt SD card, or
    if you've been editing the default system files.  Check the online help
    for the CLI in question to see if re-initalising the tool is an option.
    
3:  Bucket Not Found.  You requested a bucket that does not exist. This may
    not actually be an error, if you were checking for the existance of a bucket
    before creating it, etc. But the code is the same.
