NextZXOS Integration
====================

Many features of NextPi require NextZXOS tools to automate, or integrate fully.
For example `pisend` enables you to send files and commands to NextPi. So, in
that regard it's worth remembering that many features of NextPi won't be in a
usable state, or sometimes testable at all without these tools or manual effort.

The lack of these tools/features _IS_ _NOT_ _A_ _BUG_.  This repository, and
archive is for NextPi primarily.   

There will be, from time to time, some tools that may feature in the /testing 
directory - but these are convenience items, not intended to be part of the
Next operating system.  Any formal/completed tools that are pending addition
to the OS, or tightly coupled to this release, will be (if they exist at any
one time) in /NextZXOS and then the approriate directory that they are intended
to be in, eventually, when merged.

Both the tools in /testing, and in /NextZXOS are to be used at your peril - 
caveat emptor - you have been warned.
