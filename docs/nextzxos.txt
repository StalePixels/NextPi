NextZXOS Integration
====================

Many features of NextPi require NextZXOS tools to automate, or integrate fully.
For example `pisend` enables you to send files and commands to NextPi. So, in
that regard it's worth remembering that many features of NextPi won't be in a
usable state, or sometimes testable at all without these tools or manual effort.

The lack of these tools/features _IS_ _NOT_ _A_ _BUG_.  This repository, and
archive is for NextPi primarily.

There will be, from time to time, some tools that may feature in the /testing 
directory - but these are convenience items, and possibly not intended to be
part of the Next operating system.  Any formal/completed tools that are pending
addition to the OS, or tightly coupled to this release, will be (if they exist
at any one time) in /NextZXOS and then the approriate directory that they are
intended to be in, eventually, when merged.  

The source of any open source Pi tools that are provided to work with NextPi 
can be found as submodules in /clients - these aren't intended to be exclusively
for NextZXOS, although currently the only ones that exist are for 
NextZXOS/ESXDOS - pull requests for submodules to different tools and operating
systems are welcomed.

The tools in /testing, /NextZXOS and linked in /clients are to be used at your
peril - caveat emptor - buyer beware - your milage may vary - danger ahead - 
you have been warned.
