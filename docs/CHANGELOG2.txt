CHANGELOG for NextPi2 - See CHANGELOG1 for DietPi1 development

Version 1.53A DietPi for Next - Shout, SHOUT - Let is all out... 🗯️
 * New nextpi-cache option:
    SPACE - returns the quantity of empty space left in the cache, in bytes
    PURGE - finds and removes a single bucket, based upon reverse chronological
      order of access (i.e., the oldest buckets get removed first) 
 * Fixed next-cache_file get now updates the bucket access time to make using
      buckets so is "purge friendly" without explicitly having "touch" buckets
 * Fixed a bunch of new typos in recently written docs

Things that DID change since 1.52A 
 * Broken - nextpi-z88dk_switch no longer works properly.  This needs to be 
     reworked to handle the Z88DK environment variables properly on a RO SD card
 
Things that DIDNOT change since 1.52A 
 * Fixed newline at end of cache error codes breaking client readback

Things that DIDNOT change since 1.51A 
 * New nextpi-cache admin options:
    ADMIN_INIT - used to turn an empty directory into a cache (if mounting to
      an external USB drive - not yet suported, planned future usecase, or was
      manually removed in error for any reason)
    ADMIN_RESET - used to remove all the cache contents, and then recreate
      it and the catalog, if it becomes corrupt beyond use, uses ADMIN_INIT to
      recreate the cache instance

Things that DIDNOT change since 1.50A 
 * New NextPi CLIAPI commands:
   nextp-z88dk_switch - use to setup a specific SDK varient
   z88dk now setup by default, system will use 2.1 - see wiki for use details
 * New nextpi-cache admin options:
    ADMIN_WRITE_DISABLE and ADMIN_WRITE_ENABLE -- use with caution!
 * New nextpi-cache_file CLI:
    PUT, RENAME, DELETE and GET files from the cache
 * Fixed Installation Type fingerprint

Things that DIDNOT change since 1.40A 
 * New nextpi-cache_file CLIAPI - adds file to a cache_bucket 
      (other functions are stubs, currently)

 * Fixed return-codes for next-cache_bucket ==0 for success, >0 on failure
 * em00k's NextBuild removed - in favour of upcoming rockdemon version

 * Fixed some nextpi-cache_bucket CLIAPI naming inconsistencies

Things that DIDNOT change since 1.30A

      all massively slimmed down to reduce SD card space from 4.1GB
      to under 430MB, cumulative, for all four versions combined.

Things that DIDNOT change since 1.22A

       when invoking without a switch it remains NextPi1 compatible

    Items worthy of note:
     Partitions.txt
     cli_error_codes.txt 
 * em00k's NextBuild included

   more reliable binary compilation, and testing

 * New Surpressed kernel bootlogs


Things that DIDNOT change since Alpha 1.12A
 * New MIDI Playback API now supports three modes LQ, MQ, and HQ - of various

Things that DIDNOT change since Alpha 1.11A
 * MIDI Playback API
 * New fluidsynth, GM & GS sound fonts
 * New Freepats sound patches - a free patch set suitable for MIDI audio
   synthesis.  It is not complete, nor comprehensive yet, and most, if not all
