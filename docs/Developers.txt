Development Environments
========================

The (current) default available packages are in packages.txt.

Python2.7 is "promised" for the final install.
xboxdrv linux interface will be present.

Special Package Requests will be considered. Please contact me on Discord in the
 #nextpi channel and tag me.

How To Make "Your Linux" like nextPi linux.

This is about making _your_ linux compatible with Next software written for
 NextPi Linux. It does not concern itself with Linux housekeeping, your exact
 variety of Linux, hardening, or preventing system failure like corrupt 
 filesytem from reboots, etc.

 * The following directories are expected to exist - the main filesystem
   does NOT have to be RO on your personal distro:
     /ram
     /NextPi
     /PCache

 * The contents of the /opt/nextpi are available, "somewhere" at the same 
   paths on your distro, and the items in /opt/nextpi/bin are in $PATH.
 
 * Scripts in /opt/nextpi/bin all behave as expected - please edit these to 
   suit your distro.  nextpi-admin_* can be "stubbed out" - you won't need 
   these, these scripts admin the nextpi distro changes itself, not the generic
   Linux pi environment. The only exception to this is probably 
   nextpi-admin_report, this may still be useful/used by tools on the Next that
   are looking to report the status of the Pi.

 * /opt/nextpi/supervisor/supervisor has replaced your default GETTY on 
   /dev/ttyS0@115200 (ttyAMA0 on most SBCs) - the supervisor script reflects the
   RW status of the / filesystem, based on /dev/root - this may not work on your
   setup, but as long as it does not error, this should not matter -- there are 
   currently no tools on the next that use the admin status of the filesystem, 
   so RO or RW should not make any difference to the next side.

 * A package environment analagous to the contents of /docs/package-lists are
   installed on your system.
   
One final note
--------------
The /tools folder, in the root in this repo, will go some way to helping you
 create a compatible filesystem - but could also turn your SSD into Jam.  It's
 advised you read this script before running it, especially as it runs as root.
 
 Pull requests to these scripts will be entertained, as long as they don't break
 the internal development system we use to maintain NextPi ;-)
